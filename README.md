Udacity P7-1 Neighborhood map API project - Rose Tremlett

**BERLIN BIERGARTEN FINDER**

This app helps you find all the beer gardens in Berlin, and helps you figure out which ones are the most popular by seeing how many people have checked in on Foursquare!

This app uses the Google Maps Javascript API and the Foursquare API to retrive the data used. 

**To run this site, follow the steps below:**


1. To run from disc, simply right-click on 'index.html' (either in dist folder for compressed site or src folder for editable files etc) and use 'Open with...' to launch the website in your preferred browser 

2. To run from a local host, download and install Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/ - installed as default on Mac). Hold shift and right-click on the folder containing the site files (website-optim) and select 'Open command window here'. Type 'python -m http.server 8080' (no speechmarks) and then launch the website as in 1. If you are using Python 2 or below, you will need to type 'python -m simpleHTTPServer 8080'.

3. To view FourSquare check-in information about a beer garden, simply click on either the map marker or the list item to open a pop-up window. 

4. To filter the search results and the markers on the map, simply type a search term into the search box in the top left of the screen (top of the screen on mobile). The beer gardens will be filtered immediately in response to what you type!
